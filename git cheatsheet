To view the branch in a git repository:
  git branch
  git branch -a # To view all local and remote branches, branch with * is the one you currently on.
  git branch -r # show only remote branches
  
Checkout existing branch:
  git checkout BRANCH-NAME # works only if current directory is clean, have 3 options trash/stas/commit changes before this.
  
Create a new branch and start working on it:
  git branch NEW-BRANCH-NAME
  git checkout NEW-BRANCH-NAME
  #Shortcut
  git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH-NAME # NEW-BRACNCH-NAME is based on the branch you are currently on.
  
Rename a branch:
  git branch -m OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
  OR
  git branch --move OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
  
Delete a branch:
Git won’t let you delete a branch that you’re currently on. You first need to checkout a different branch, then run the command:
  git branch -d BRANCH-TO-DELETE
# Alternative:
  git branch --delete BRANCH-TO-DELETE
Git will throw an error if the changes in the branch you’re trying to delete are not fully merged into the current branch. 
You can override this and force Git to delete the branch with the -D option (note the capital letter) or using the --force option 
with -d or --delete :
  git branch -D BRANCH-TO-DELETE
# Alternatives
  git branch -d --force BRANCH-TO-DELETE
  git branch --delete --force BRANCH-TO-DELETE
#To delete a remote branch
  git push origin --delete branch-name
Compare branches
  git diff FIRST-BRANCH..SECOND-BRANCH

Push your changes:
  git add 
  git commit
  git push <repository> <refspec> # If not specified <repository> is origin by default, 
 # <resfspec> is src:dest, src is change you want to push, could be branch name/HEAD/master~4 etc... 
 # dst is branch where you want to push, dst can be omitted,
  git push -u <repository> <refspec>
 # If you are publishing a local branch for the first time on a remote, the "-u" option is helpful. 
 # It makes sure that a tracking connection between the local and the newly created remote branch is established
 
 To push a local branch to remote:
  git push origin <BRANCH-NAME>:<REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME> #REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME cna be omitted, 
 # if we want to push same branch name as local name
